# Portfolio Website

## Description

This repository contains all the source code of my personal website. I constantly update my website as there are new contents coming up.

## Development

I used `webpack` to automate the build process and `npm` to download all the necessary javascript library dependencies. The process to run this repository is very straightforward

1. download all necessary npm packages

```
$ npm install
```

2. run the project

```
$ npm run start
```

To build the production files, run the following:

```
$ npm run build
```

The production files will be in the `dist/` folder.

## Deployment

I deployed and set up a customized domain with Github pages since it is one the the fastest way to deploy a static website with an index.html file, and it is totally free
