        Overview and Usage
      </h6>

      <p class="lead mb-2 mt-7" style="font-size: 18px;" >
        Overview: I am using the p5.js library to create a gluttonous snake game. To start playing, click the "Start Game" button, and you will enter the game immediately. There is a score panel in the top left corner that displays the number of points you have earned (which corresponds to the number of red boxes the snake eats). If the snake eats itself or hits the wall (the edge of the browser window), the game is over. There are power-up foods embedded in this new version of the game. This special food will either speed up the snake or make the snake longer.

        You can restart the game by clicking the "Start Game" button again. Enjoy the game!

        Final Project scope
      </h6>
      <div>
        My final version of the Snake game now includes more interesting features that were specified in the proposal and have been implemented. Building upon the prototype, this version includes an introduction panel that explains the rules of the game and the different types of fruit that can be eaten by the snake, along with the corresponding abilities that the snake gains after eating each fruit. Additionally, I have added a report page that appears after the game ends, allowing users to view their scores. To help users keep track of their highest score, I utilized the browser's local storage to store this information. As a result, my project scope has expanded beyond its initial plan, and these additions have significantly improved the overall quality and user experience of the game.

        Final Project Time management Summary
      </h6>
      <div>
        Adding the introduction panel and game-over page to the game was relatively straightforward. However, adding the feature to record the user's highest score took longer. I had to learn how to use the browser's local storage to store the highest score, and figure out where to call the "localStorage.getItem" and "localStorage.setItem" functions in the game. Consequently, I dedicated most of my time to solving this problem.

        Development Process
      </h6>
      <div>The final version of the game was built on top of the previous prototype, Here's a step-by-step overview of how to add new features to the gluttonous snake game using p5.js:</div>

      <ol>
        <li>Identify the new features to be added to the game, which include an introduction page and a game-over page.</li>
        <li>Created new HTML pgae to show the "gameover" page</li>
        <li>Create a new JavaScript file for the introduction page, and write the necessary code to display the rules of the game.</li>
        <li>Create a new JavaScript file for the game-over page, and write the necessary code to display the user's score.</li>
        <li>Modify the draw function to include new features such as displaying the score and updating the game-over page.</li>
        <li>Update the Snake class or any other class used in the game to accommodate the new features.</li>
        <li>Test the game with the new features and make necessary adjustments.</li>
        <li>Optimize the code and remove any bugs that may have arisen during the implementation of the new features.</li>
        <li>Publish the updated game for users to enjoy.</li>
    </ol>

        Issue
      </h6>
      <div>During the game creation process, I encountered an issue where the localStorage for the highest score could not be set properly. Here are the steps I took to resolve the issue:</div>
      <ol>
        <li>I located the correct function for setting the localStorage in the game.</li>
        <li>I updated this function accordingly.</li>
        <li>I tested the function using the console panel to ensure that it worked properly.</li>
    </ol>

      <div>As a result of these steps, I was able to resolve the issue and make the game work.</div>

        Ideas and Future:
      </h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Add more types of food for the snake to eat, each with unique effects.</li>
        <li>Create a multiplayer mode for multiple people to compete with each other.</li>
        <li>Replace the snake with more high-fidelity images instead of using rectangles.</li>
        <li>Provide notifications to users when the snake eats a power-up fruit.</li>
      </ul>
      <div>Ultimately, the ideas and features I choose to add to my website should align with my goals for the site and the audience I hope to reach.</div>
