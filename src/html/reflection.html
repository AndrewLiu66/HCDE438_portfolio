        Overview
      </h6>

      <ol>
        <li>Set up my development environment. I started by installing a text editor (I used Visual Studio Code) and any necessary dependencies (such as Node.js and npm).</li>
        <li>Created a new project folder and initialized my project using npm. To do this, I opened a terminal window, navigated to my project folder, and ran the following command: npm init -y. This created a package.json file in my project folder.</li>
        <li>Installed the necessary packages for my project. This typically involved installing Bootstrap (using npm install bootstrap) and any other dependencies that my project required.</li>
        <li>Created the HTML structure for my website. I created an index.html file and added the necessary HTML elements (such as &lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, and &lt;div&gt;) to create the structure of my website.</li>
        <li>Added the necessary CSS styles for my website. I did this by creating a scss folder and adding a couple of scss files to that folder. I then linked to my stylesheet in the <head> of my index.html file using a <link> element.</li>
        <li>Added the necessary JavaScript functionality for my website. I did this by creating a js folder and adding a script (such as main.js) to that folder.</li>
        <li>Set up Webpack for my project. To do this, I installed Webpack (using npm install webpack) and created a configuration file (such as webpack.config.js). I also added a build script to my package.json file to create a production build of my website.</li>
        <li>Tested my website locally to ensure that it was working as expected. I did this by running a local development server (such as webpack-dev-server) and opening my website in a web browser.</li>
        <li>Deployed my website to github page. This typically involved creating a production build of my website using the build script I added in step 7, and uploading the built files to my hosting provider or server.</li>
      </ol>

        Issue
      </h6>

      <div>I recently encountered an issue when trying to push my changes to a remote repository on GitHub. When I ran the git push command, I received an error message that said "fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch." After some investigation, I realized that the issue was caused by a misconfigured local repository. To resolve the issue, I followed the steps below:</div>

      <ol>
        <li>Check the status of my local repository by running the command git status.</li>
        <li>If the local repository was not configured to track a remote branch, run the command git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master to set the upstream branch.</li>
        <li>Try pushing my changes to the remote repository again using the git push command.</li>
      </ol>


      <div>After following these steps, I was able to successfully push my changes to the remote repository on GitHub.</div>

            CSS Transition
        </h6>

        <div>
            I implemented a CSS transition on the .home_desc element that caused the font size to change when the element was hovered over. The transition was set to take 0.5 seconds to complete and used a cubic-bezier easing function to create a smooth animation. The final font size was set to 20px.

            I chose this CSS transition because I wanted to add a dynamic and visually appealing element to my website. The hover effect helped to draw the user's attention to the element and make the website more engaging.

            To make the transition work, I added the transition and :hover properties to the .home_desc element in my stylesheet. I also specified the duration, easing function, and final font size for the transition.

            Here's an example gif of the CSS transition in action: [Insert gif here]

            Here is an example gif of the CSS transition in action:
        </div>

        <div class="ms-auto mb-10" style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;">
            <pre style="background-color: #e8e7e6; color: #6b6b6a; border-radius: 10px; margin: 0 20px;">
              <div style="margin-right: 30px;">
                .home_desc {
                    transition: font-size 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1) !important;
                }

                .home_desc:hover {
                    font-size: 20px !important;
                }

              </div>
            </pre>
            <img src="{{webRoot}}/assets/img/animation/animation.gif" class="mx-auto mt-6 mb-6" style="display: block; width: 600px; height: 300px;" alt="Animated GIF">
          </div>



        <div>
            For some other animations, I implemented a CSS transition using the data-aos attribute. The data-aos attribute is a part of the AOS (Animate on Scroll) library, which allowed me to add animations to my website as the user scrolled through the page.

            I used the fade-right animation, which caused the images to fade in from the right as the user scrolled down the page. I also added a data-aos-delay attribute to some of the images, which added a delay before the animation began.

            I may have chosen this CSS transition because it added a dynamic and visually appealing element to the website. It could also help to draw the user's attention to the images and make the website more engaging.

            To make the transition work, I included the AOS library in my project and added the data-aos attribute to the elements that I wanted to animate. I then customized the animation and delay using the available options in the AOS library.
